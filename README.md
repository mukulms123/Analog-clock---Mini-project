# Analog-clock---Mini-project
## A good C++ graphics based program, if you are looking for mini projects.
This Project was given to my team as a mini project. The biggest task in this project was to calculate location and per second changes in all three hands of clock.
One will understand the problem once he/she will look up the code.
